# Project-2
For CS-210
 The problem this project was solving was essentially making a banking application for a company called Airgead. Overall I felt the thing I did the most well on was writing the code and making it relatively easy to read and understand. My psuedocode could have been portrayed and laid out better than it was. To make my project even better I could have implemented a GUI to go along with it. Doing so would improve it tremedously in my opinion. I think it would make it more realistic and could make it seem more functional to users who don't neccesarily know about coding. Giving it a design and actually making it functional for a user would probably be the most beneficial route to go. The most challenging part to me was making the part to obtain the data from the the user. In order to get over that I just referred back to Zybooks which helped me tremendously. The skills I learned from this project will help me a ton down the road as it just helped me familiarize myself with realistic projects that I could potentially use in the real world. Trial and error for hours is how I made this program readable and adaptable. The thing I made sure I took the most time on was in line comments so I could ensure the person viewing the code knew what they were looking at.
